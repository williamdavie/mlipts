# Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials - Training Suite (MLIPTS).

Seemless data collection for training/fine-tuning machine learned interatomic potentials. The key idea behind MLIPTS, is to perform the following active learning workflow with as little user input as possible:

> [!NOTE]
> The scope of a fully-fledged software to perform seemless MLIP training is significant, with many ways to quantify data quality. Version 1.0.0 is a proof of concept. 
> Contributors are welcome to help make this goal a reality.
